n,k=map(int,input().split())
a=list(map(int,input().split()))
b=['0']*k
for i in a:
    for j in range(i-1,k):
        if(b[j]=='0'): b[j]='1'
        else: b[j]='0'
print(int(''.join(b),2))

Output:-
5 5
2 1 3 1 4
11

6 7
3 4 5 1 7 2
86

Explanation:
Here K = 5, so the string S is formed with 5 zeroes 00000.
The 1st integer is 2, so the characters from the 2nd position are toggled. Now the string S becomes 01111.
The 2nd integer is 1, so the characters from the 1st position are toggled. Now the string S becomes 10000.
The 3rd integer is 3, so the characters from the 3rd position are toggled. Now the string S becomes 10111.
The 4th integer is 1, so the characters from the 1st position are toggled. Now the string S becomes 01000.
The 5th integer is 4, so the characters from the 4th position are toggled. Now the string S becomes 01011.
The decimal equivalent of 01011 is 11.
So 11 is printed as the output.
