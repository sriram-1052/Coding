Explanation:
Here N = 5 and X = 4.
If the 1st student wins, the total score of the 1st student becomes 7 (3+4) which is the highest score in the class. So 1 is printed.
If the 2nd student wins, the total score of the 2nd student becomes 6 (2+4) which is the highest score in the class. So 1 is printed.
If the 3rd student wins, the total score of the 3rd student becomes 10 (6+4) which is the highest score in the class. So 1 is printed.
If the 4th student wins, the total score of the 4th student becomes 5 (1+4) which is NOT the highest score in the class. So 0 is printed.
If the 5th student wins, the total score of the 5th student becomes 9 (5+4) which is the highest score in the class. So 1 is printed.
Hence the output is
1 1 1 0 1
