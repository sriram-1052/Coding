Explanation:
Here S = skillrack.
The common part between S and the 1st string is k. So the concatenated string is skillracking, which is printed in the 1st line.
The common part between S and the 2nd string is rack. So the concatenated string is skillracks, which is printed in the 2nd line.
There is no common part between S and the 3rd string. So -1 is printed in the 3rd line.
The common part between S and the 4th string is ack. So the concatenated string is skillracknowledge, which is printed in the 4th line.
The string S and the 5th string are equal. So the string skillrack is printed as it is.
